# Udemy React Course
This is the main readme file for the Udemy [React Course](https://www.udemy.com/react-the-complete-guide-incl-redux/) I am following on Udemy.

My goal is to practice React at least two hours a day until January 1st, using the React course as a baseline to study from.  Below is a table of contents of notes to each section in the Udemy course, and inside each section is documentation of what I've learned and practice exercises.

On January 1st I will evaluate what I learned and list any projects I made using React in this readme file.
