# Udemy React Course

This is the main readme file for the Udemy [React Course](https://www.udemy.com/react-the-complete-guide-incl-redux/) I am following on Udemy.

My goal is to practice React at least two hours a day until January 1st, using the React course as a baseline to study from.  Below is a table of contents of notes to each section in the Udemy course, and inside each section is documentation of what I've learned and practice exercises.

On January 1st I will evaluate what I learned and list any projects I made using React in this readme file. (Updated below)

## Update Jan. 2, 2018

For the most part I stuck with doing at least an hour of React everyday.  Although there were some missed opportunities, I feel like for the most part the month was productive as far as learning React concepts.

I still have many things to learn and practice, but following the projects I've done and the projects from the tutorials I believe I have the fundamentals down to create a basic React website or application.

The next step is to continue practicing layouts with React and to also create more applications that involve dynamic data.  Being more creative with my projects will force me to solve more problems and in turn become a better developer.

As far as the tutorials, I will continue onto section 9 and 10 for the month, which involve Http / Ajax requests.
