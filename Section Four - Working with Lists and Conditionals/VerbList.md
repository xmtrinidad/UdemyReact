# Section Project - Verb List

## Goals

* Learn how to create a list component, iterating over items in state (Verb List)

* Practice two-way binding (Typing in input, show verb translation under the Spanish verb)

* Set conditional validation based on input (If the English translation is correct display checkmark, else continue showing an X)

* Flexible lists (Display multiple cards with input boxes and manipulate only the card that is being changed)

* Hide/show Verv List items conditionally (When the correct answer is typed into the Card component input box, remove item from list)
