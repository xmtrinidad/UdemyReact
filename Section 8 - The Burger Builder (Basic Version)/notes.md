## Setting up the Project

1. Enable CSS Modules

The purpose of this is so that the CSS classes created within a CSS file can be scoped to a component and not applied globally if used in another component.

To get this started, React needs to be "ejected" by running the command ```npm run eject```.  This will give access to the build configuration so that they can be edited to allow CSS modules.

The process for enabling CSS modules at this point can be found at the [Section 5 readme file](https://github.com/xmtrinidad/UdemyReact/blob/master/Section%205%20-%20Styling%20React%20Components%20%26%20Elements/notes.md#enabling-and-using-css-modules)

2.  Remove starter templates
